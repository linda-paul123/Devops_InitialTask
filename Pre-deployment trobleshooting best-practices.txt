1 Code Quality Checks
----------------------
Static Code Analysis: Use tools like sonar qube,pyLint,ESLint or Flake8 to analyse your code for syntax errors,unused variables and code smells.
integrate thse tools with cicd pipeline.
Eg. In python we can usew pyLint or Flake8 to check basic code quality.
flake8 your_code.py
pylint your_code.py

Unit Testing: Ensure that unit tests are written for all critical components and run consistently diring the development process.
tools :  pytest, unittest, Jest, etc.
eg, pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
Test Coverage: test code test coverage tool like coveralls,codecov etc.

Build and Dependency Management:
for eg, we can use virtual environment for applications like python virtual environment.
