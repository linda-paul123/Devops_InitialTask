1. Set Up Monitoring on Your Local Server (Backend + MySQL)
A. Backend Application Monitoring
For the backend (FastAPI), youâ€™ll want to monitor:

API request rate (requests per second)

Response time (latency)

Error rate (500 errors, exceptions)

Tools for Monitoring Backend:
Prometheus + Grafana: Use Prometheus to collect metrics from your backend application and Grafana to visualize the data.

Uptime Kuma: Simple and self-hosted monitoring for your backend uptime.

1.Install Prometheus & Grafana on Local Server:
Install Prometheus:
Download and install Prometheus on your local server.

Configure Prometheus to scrape data from your backend's metrics endpoint (FastAPI exposes metrics with /metrics endpoint).
2.Install Grafana:

Install Grafana and connect it to Prometheus as a data source.

Create dashboards for API performance metrics and system health.
3.FastAPI Metrics (Example using prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator)

from prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator import Instrumentator

instrumentator = Instrumentator()
app = FastAPI()
instrumentator.instrument(app).expose(app)
4.set-up Alert:Use Alertmanager (integrated with Prometheus) to set up alerts if API errors spike or response time exceeds the threshold.
B. MySQL Database Monitoring
For MySQL, want to monitor,
Query performance: slow queries, total queries executed.

Connection status: number of active connections, replication health.

System health: CPU usage, disk space usage, and memory consumption.
Tools for monitoring MySQL
Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM): Provides detailed insights into MySQL performance.

MySQL Enterprise Monitor: Enterprise solution for deep MySQL performance monitoring.
